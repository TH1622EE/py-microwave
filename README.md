The repository includes three moules:

### mwave.py

A module including a lot of methods for:

 * creating and cascading two-port networks
 * convert two-port networks between S, Z, Y, ABCD representation
 * plot frequency response
 * import/export touchstone and mdif
 * calculating microstrip line geometries, vias, coupled lines 
 * convert and handle complex values
 * design amplifiers with stability, gain calculations, gain circles, stability circles, noise behaviour

### smith.py
